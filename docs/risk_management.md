# Risk Management Guide

This guide provides detailed information about the risk management features in the Solana Memecoin Trading Bot.

## Overview

The risk management system helps protect your capital by:

1. Assessing token risk levels
2. Calculating appropriate position sizes
3. Monitoring portfolio allocation
4. Recommending risk reduction actions
5. Refining parameters based on real-world performance

## Risk Profiles

The bot supports three risk profiles:

| Profile | Description | Max Allocation | Max Position | Stop Loss | Max Drawdown |
|---------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Conservative | Prioritizes capital preservation | 20% | 2% | 5% | 10% |
| Moderate | Balanced approach (default) | 40% | 5% | 10% | 20% |
| Aggressive | Prioritizes potential returns | 60% | 10% | 15% | 30% |

To change your risk profile, use the `risk` command in the CLI.

## Token Risk Levels

Tokens are categorized into four risk levels:

| Risk Level | Description | Max Allocation |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Low | Established tokens with high liquidity | 60% |
| Medium | Tokens with moderate risk | 30% |
| High | Speculative tokens | 10% |
| Very High | Extremely speculative tokens | 5% |

The risk level is determined by analyzing:
- Token age
- Liquidity
- Holder distribution
- Contract features
- Market volatility

## Position Sizing

The risk manager calculates recommended position sizes based on:
1. Your risk profile
2. Token risk level
3. Current portfolio allocation
4. Available capital

For example, a moderate risk profile might allocate:
- 5% of portfolio to low-risk tokens
- 3.75% to medium-risk tokens
- 2.5% to high-risk tokens
- 1.25% to very high-risk tokens

## Portfolio Monitoring

The system continuously monitors your portfolio to:
1. Track allocation across risk levels
2. Calculate portfolio drawdown
3. Identify overexposure to specific risk categories
4. Recommend position adjustments

Use the `portfolio` command to view your current risk metrics.

## Stop-Loss Recommendations

Stop-loss percentages are automatically adjusted based on:
1. Token risk level
2. Your risk profile
3. Market volatility

Higher risk tokens receive wider stop-losses to account for volatility.

## Risk Parameter Refinement

The risk management system can refine its parameters based on real-world performance:

1. **Performance Analysis**: The system analyzes your trading history to identify patterns in successful and unsuccessful trades.

2. **Risk Allocation Adjustment**: If certain risk levels consistently perform better or worse than expected, allocation limits are adjusted accordingly.

3. **Drawdown Management**: If portfolio drawdown exceeds expectations, max drawdown parameters are adjusted to better reflect market conditions.

4. **Profile Optimization**: Risk profiles are fine-tuned based on actual trading outcomes.

## Configuration Options

You can customize risk management through the following configuration options:

```
# Enable/disable risk management
risk_management_enabled=true

# Set risk profile (conservative, moderate, aggressive)
risk_profile=moderate

# Risk allocation limits
max_low_risk_allocation_percent=60.0
max_medium_risk_allocation_percent=30.0
max_high_risk_allocation_percent=10.0
max_very_high_risk_allocation_percent=5.0

# Conservative profile parameters
conservative_max_allocation_percent=20.0
conservative_max_position_percent=2.0
conservative_stop_loss_percent=5.0
conservative_max_drawdown_percent=10.0

# Moderate profile parameters
moderate_max_allocation_percent=40.0
moderate_max_position_percent=5.0
moderate_stop_loss_percent=10.0
moderate_max_drawdown_percent=20.0

# Aggressive profile parameters
aggressive_max_allocation_percent=60.0
aggressive_max_position_percent=10.0
aggressive_stop_loss_percent=15.0
aggressive_max_drawdown_percent=30.0
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with the conservative profile until you're comfortable with the system.

2. **Regular Portfolio Review**: Use the `portfolio` command regularly to check your risk metrics.

3. **Gradual Risk Increase**: Only increase your risk profile after demonstrating consistent success.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across different risk levels rather than concentrating in one category.

5. **Respect Recommendations**: Follow position size and stop-loss recommendations to maintain proper risk management.

6. **Monitor Drawdown**: Pay close attention to portfolio drawdown as an early warning sign.

7. **Periodic Refinement**: Allow the system to refine parameters periodically based on your trading history.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Position sizes too small**: Check your risk profile and portfolio value. Conservative profiles with small portfolios will generate small position sizes.

2. **Unable to take positions**: You may have reached your allocation limit for a particular risk level. Check your portfolio metrics.

3. **Frequent stop-loss triggers**: Consider using a more conservative risk profile or focusing on lower-risk tokens.

### Getting Help

1. Check the logs at `~/.solana-trading-bot/logs/trading_bot.log`
2. Look for warnings or errors related to risk management
3. Verify your configuration settings
